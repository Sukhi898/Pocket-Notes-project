## React Module Test - Pocket Notes

### Problem Statement:

My challenge is to build out a minimal note-taking app.

### Features List:

- User should be able to create a group for notes. A popup opens up to create a new group, and the user can choose a color for the group. If the user clicks outside the popup, it should close automatically.
- User should be able to add notes in a particular group. Along with notes, the note creation date and time should be displayed.
- User should be able to save the note by clicking on the Send icon in the text input area. If no text is present, the Send icon should be disabled.
- Notes should be saved in local storage, ensuring that all notes and groups persist on page reload/refresh.
- As soon as the user changes the group, all notes related to that particular group should be fetched and displayed.
- The project should include both desktop and mobile responsive designs.
- All kinds of validation checks and error handling related to groups and notes should be implemented.
- Follow all instructions mentioned in the Figma design page provided for the test.
- The final output should match the design provided in Figma.
